```

## üîß **What You Should Do Next**

### 1. **Update Your Schema** (Required)
```bash
# Apply the new schema to your database
yarn db:generate
yarn db:push

# Seed with comprehensive data

```

### 2. **Configure Environment Variables**
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env.local

# Edit with your values:
# - ADMIN_USERNAME (change from default)
# - ADMIN_PASSWORD (use a strong password)
# - JWT_SECRET (32+ characters)
# - EmailJS credentials for contact form
```

### 3. **Test Your Admin System**

# - Railway (railway.app)

# Deploy
yarn deploy:vercel
```

**Option B: Self-hosted Docker**
```bash
# Configure production environment
cp env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with production values
