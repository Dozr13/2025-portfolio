# Prisma Power Techniques for High‑Velocity Teams

> Prisma gives you incredible DX. These techniques make it scale with your product and your team.

## 1) Model enums and domain enums (and when to map)

Use Prisma enums for DB consistency, but export **domain enums** for app code. Map at the edge (actions/services):

```ts
// app domain types
export type ProjectStatus = 'PLANNING' | 'IN_PROGRESS' | 'COMPLETED' | 'MAINTAINED' | 'ARCHIVED'

// at the boundary
const status = input.status as import('@@/generated/client').$Enums.ProjectStatus
```

This avoids leaking the Prisma client into client bundles and keeps your domain portable.

## 2) Select less, compute more

```ts
const project = await prisma.project.findUnique({
  where: { id },
  select: { id: true, title: true, _count: { select: { projectViews: true } } }
})
```

Prefer `select` / `include` with intent. Compute derived fields in the action.

## 3) Batched reads > N+1

Use `in` filters, `groupBy`, and batched `Promise.all` when reading related records. Consider Dataloader only when necessary.

## 4) Safe JSON fields

Wrap JSON parse/stringify behind helpers that return typed defaults—no `any` escapes.

## 5) Soft deletes and historical auditing

- Add `deletedAt` and filter on every `findMany` by default.
- Create audit tables (or use triggers) for critical entities and log who changed what.

## 6) Migrations you can trust

- Keep `schema.prisma` authoritative; generate SQL migrations via `prisma migrate`.
- In CI, run `prisma migrate deploy` on prod and `prisma db push` only for ephemeral preview environments.

## 7) Transaction ergonomics

Prefer interactive transactions when multiple steps must be atomic:

```ts
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const post = await tx.blogPost.create({ data })
  await tx.projectView.create({ data: { projectId /* … */ } })
})
```

## 8) Testing strategy

- Use a disposable Postgres (Docker/Neon branch) for integration tests.
- Seed via idempotent upserts; avoid random data that breaks snapshots.

## 9) Observability hooks

Enable Prisma query logging in dev; in prod, log slow queries and failed transactions with correlation ids.

## 10) Performance checklist

- [ ] Index your foreign keys and commonly filtered columns
- [ ] Paginate everything that grows
- [ ] Avoid `include` waterfalls — select what you render
- [ ] Don’t JSON.stringify large arrays into text fields without a reason

Prisma is a DX multiplier. With these patterns, it’s also a scalability multiplier.
