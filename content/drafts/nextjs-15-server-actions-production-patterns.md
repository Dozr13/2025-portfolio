# Next.js 15 Server Actions: Production Patterns and Pitfalls

> Server Actions turn your React components into full-stack UI. This article distills hard‑won patterns for shipping them to production with great DX and zero drama.

## Why Server Actions (really) matter

Server Actions remove the boilerplate between UI and server. Instead of wiring a `/api/*` route, serializing JSON, validating twice, and orchestrating loading states, you export an async function with `"use server"` and call it from your component. You get:

- Strong typing end‑to‑end with zero schema duplication
- Simple data‑mutation flow (no hand‑rolled API clients)
- Automatic streaming + partial re-render via the App Router

But production quality requires discipline. Here’s the playbook.

## 1) Validate everything at the edge of your action

```ts
'use server'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma'

const createContactSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.string().email(),
  subject: z.string().min(1),
  message: z.string().min(1)
})

export async function createContact(input: unknown) {
  const data = createContactSchema.parse(input) // throws on bad input
  // … domain logic
  return prisma.contact.create({ data })
}
```

- Use Zod (or Valibot) directly inside the action.
- Treat `unknown` as a feature, not a bug.

## 2) Authenticate and authorize inside the action (not the UI)

- Derive auth from cookies/headers on the server. Don’t trust the client’s props.
- Express intent with helpers: `ensureAdmin()` / `requireUser()`.
- Fail fast with explicit errors; return user‑safe messages.

## 3) Idempotency and UX resilience

> Users double-click buttons and the network is unreliable.

- Add idempotency keys for operations that can be re‑sent (e.g., checkout, contact form).
- For optimistic UI, prefer `useFormStatus()` and `useOptimistic()` patterns; reconcile with the action result.

```tsx
const [optimisticList, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(list, (curr, next) => [next, ...curr])

<form action={async (f) => {
  const draft = formToDraft(f)
  addOptimistic(draft)
  const saved = await createPost(draft)
}}>
```

## 4) Caching tactics that won’t bite you later

- Use fetch cache wisely for reads; most actions are writes and should be uncached.
- After a mutation, revalidate what changed, not the world:

```ts
import { revalidatePath, revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'

await prisma.post.create({ data })
revalidatePath('/blog')
revalidateTag('post:list')
```

- Prefer stable tags (e.g., `post:list`, `post:42`) so downstream components can opt‑in.

## 5) File uploads with Server Actions

- Stream to S3 (or R2) from the server, not via the browser when you need auth‑gated flows.
- Validate type/size on the server; generate signed URLs per upload.

## 6) Error boundaries and failure ergonomics

- Wrap action calls in component‑level error boundaries.
- Return discriminated unions `{ success: true, data } | { success: false, error }` for predictable UX.

## 7) Testing the right layers

- Unit test domain logic separately.
- Add integration tests calling actions directly (no browser) with mocked `cookies()`.
- Smoke test full flows with Playwright.

## 8) Migration path from REST

- Keep actions as the single source of truth.
- If you must, expose a thin `/api/*` handler that calls the same action for backwards compatibility.

## 9) Observability: log context, not noise

Include: request id, user id (hashed), input schema version, and timing. Exclude PII. Ship logs to your platform’s viewer (Vercel, Datadog, Logtail).

## 10) Checklist before shipping

- [ ] Zod at the boundary
- [ ] Auth/role checks in the action
- [ ] Idempotency on sensitive ops
- [ ] Revalidate affected paths/tags only
- [ ] Error boundaries + friendly messages
- [ ] Clean logs and metrics

Server Actions are a superpower when you respect the boundary: validate, authorize, mutate, revalidate. Keep it boring—and your app will feel instant.
